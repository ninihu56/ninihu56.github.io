    <center> <p> Hi, my name is Nini, <i><u>and I am a junior at Texas A&M University.</u></i> In my free time, I like to indulge myself in different hobbies and interests since I have quite a few. I absolutely love              anything that involves around crafting, whether that's scrapbooking, or sewing to upcycle clothes.  I also love to thrift and am always looking for my next favorite thrifting spot. I also <b>painted in high school</b>        and have not painted since, but I want to pick it up again soon as I used to be really good at it. That's it about my hobbies and interests! I hope you found it kind of fun to learn more about me!</a> </p> </center>
