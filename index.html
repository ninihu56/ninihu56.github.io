            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a Junior at Texas A&M University Studying Management Information Systems. I'm especially interested in how technology, business, and strategy come together to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on collaborative projects, thinking critically about systems and processes, and finding practical ways to make things work better.

Through my academic and project experience, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in both technical and interpersonal skills, especially in communication, leadership, and problem solving. Outside of school, I spend time painting, knitting, and crocheting. Hands-on work like this challenges my eye for detail and fuels my creative thinking.</p>
